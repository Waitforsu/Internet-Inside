In this Project, we aim to use off-the-shelf components (Raspberry Pis)  to realize a cheap and robust Internet-based wireless system. 
The ultimate goal of the project is to prototype a wireless MyG system that allows a mobile unit to connect to a base station and communicate with the Internet over IP.
